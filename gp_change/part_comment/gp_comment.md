   [ 'Decent enough game but a bit sexist that you have to pay to be the female character. Otherwise it\'s a difficult game and progression is somewhat slow, leans more to pay to win but free to play can still get some enjoyment out of it.',
     'It can be challenging to unlock the maps and upgrading the weapons and armour is hit or miss but I like the co-op and man v man options.',
     'hink if you give us More resources in start so that some easy for biggener',
     'Its gets intense in some levels. Gotta have quick thumbz to out maneuver enemies.',
     'Its totally addictive, but i think this one need more gun and armor variation' ],
